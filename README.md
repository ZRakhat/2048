# 2048
A repository for simple game 2048

File called **2048.py** is containing game componenets and algorithms.  
Also, there is a file called **High_score**, which used to store the high score value.
In case of restoring value to default, simply change the content of high score to "0".

Before getting started, following requirements should be met:  
You should have **python 3.6+** version and *pip* installed;  
Libraries **tkinter** and **random** installed.
(You can do it yourself or download **requirements.txt** and **dependecies.sh** and execute **dependecies.sh**)

As you installed the required components, simply open file **2048.py**.  
(do not forget to download **high_score** file and place it in the same folder as **2048.py**). 

If you want to modify files, simply fork this repository.
Enjoy the game!
